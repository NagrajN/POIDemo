* Built and tested on IOS 7 / IOS Simulator
* It has two view controllers 1) Map View and 2) History
* You can search an address, text , etc.
* If its found (using google client api) then we show it on the map and insert an annotation
* We use GCD to avoid blocking issues  
* We save the search history in NSUserDefaults
* The search history is displayed in a table view on a seperate tab.
* NO Unit Tests :-(
