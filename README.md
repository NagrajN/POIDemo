* Built and tested on IOS 7 / XCode 5 / IPhone Simulator 
* It has two view controllers 1) Map View and 2) History
* You can search an address, text, zip code, etc. 
* If its found (using google client api) then we show it on the map and insert an annotation
* No third party libraries, everything is Apple IOS SDK
* We use GCD to avoid blocking issues  
* We persist the search history
* The search history is displayed in a table view on a seperate tab.
* NO Unit Tests :-(
